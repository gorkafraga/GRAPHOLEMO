# GRAPHOLEMO
Scripts for Grapheme-Phoneme Learning Modelling  (postdoctoral project running from 2020-2022 at the University of Zurich). Functions for MRI analysis (Matlab), computational model of learning (R,Stan), stimuli presentation (NeurobsPresentation), statistics and visualizations (R)

## Publication scripts 
This section aims at helping finding the scripts involve in the BioRxiv publication and associated submission for peer-review (Fraga-Gonz√°lez, G., Haller, P., Willinger, D., Gehrig, V., Frei, N., & Brem, S. (2023). Neural representation of association strength and prediction error during novel symbol-speech sounds learning. bioRxiv, 2023-11. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.06.564575). 

This README aims tries to facilitate navigating through the main scripts. Please see below and contact me for clarifications if needed (contact details in publication; [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1857-8607)). 

## Abbreviations 
These are the main abbreviations used in folder names and filename parts

_Main_
-  **LEMO** shortname for the project title GRAPHOLEMO 
-  **BEH_**  behavioral
-  **MR_**  MRI
-  **feedbacklearning** feedback learning task (main task)
-  **FBL**  abbreviation of feedback learning task, FBL_A and FBL_B refer to the task parts
-  **symctrl** the visual symbol task (control visual task)
-  **ROI** region of interest analysis
-  **func** funcions usually called by scripts with 'run' in their filename
-  **run** scripts that will run analyses using functions in the same folder
-  **GLM** general linear model - used in the main MR analysis scripts. GLM0, GLM1, etc, indicate different versions
-  **rlddm** reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. The versions are added as suffix e.g., \*_rlddm_v12 , etc. Versions descriptions provided in README at the corresponding folder
-  **gpl** used in subject ID to designate the experiment  'grapheme-phoneme-learning' e.g., gpl001
- **_mopa** used in the model-based MR analyses as suffix indicating _modulating paramters_. A suffix follows indicating the modulating parameters for example:  **_mopa_aspe**: associative strenght and prediction error ; **_mopa_vpe** drift rate and prediction error 

_other_
-  **_EH.** suffix with name initials of a MSc Thesis (ignore)
-  **Allread**  refers to a previous project Allread (ignore)
-  **\_AR\_** acronym for Allread project (ignore)

## Folder overview
### Behavioral
#### BEH_cognitive
contains scripts for descriptive tables and plot on performance in the cognitive tests (reading, spelling, etc)

#### BEH_computational_models
all scripts related to running the models in Stan and preparing the data for them.
-  **LEMO_task_preprocessing** formats and prepares the task performance data for the computational models. Some operations done here are concatenate tables, trim trials with 'too slow' response, select columns gather the data in a format suited for Stan
-  **LEMO_model_run_rlddm**  runs the rlddm model in Stan: gathers the samples to create a stan fit object and extracts log lik values for model comparisons
-  **LEMO_gatherOutput**  gathers the output of the models and generate tables and plots. There is an associated function 
- **BEH_computational_models/Stan** the Stan scripts named *LEMO_rlddm_* are the scripts to compute the models in our project. Ignore subfolders *allread*  (script tests  for other project) and those referring with _bandit2arm_ (initial tests in those tasks and models as examples)
- **BEH_computational_models/data_generation** (beta) initial tests for further analysis
  
#### BEH_computational_models_compareTasks
comparisons between the model parameters derived from task parts A and B

#### BEH_correlations
Function and runner script to perform various sets of correlations between performance data and model parameters
#### BEH_redcap
ancillary scripts to gather and format tables downloaded from Redcap
#### Experiment_NeurobsPresentation
the scripts for the program Presentation (from Neurobs) to run the experiment. See README in folder for details 

#### File management 
Miscellaneous scripts used for folder preparations , file conversions, ec

#### MR_plots and tables
Misc scripts for visualization of MRI data and the results tables

#### MR_preprocessing 
Scripts starting by LEMO_\*  are the main preprocessing scripts.  **LEMO_run_wrapperPreprocessing** is used as a main preprocessing script that will call functions to create a matlabbatch for SPM 

#### MR_statistics 
**Task_feedbacklearning** contains the main analysis scripts, first and second leval with and without model parameter as modulators
**ROI** contains the main ROI analyses for the feedback learning task

#### MR_utils, Misc visualizations, Rmarkdown and Statistics_functions 
Miscellaneous scripts (some are beta versions) used for this an other projects
