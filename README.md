# GRAPHOLEMO
Scripts for Grapheme-Phoneme Learning Modelling  (postdoctoral project running from 2020-2022 at the University of Zurich). Functions for MRI analysis (Matlab), computational model of learning (R,Stan), stimuli presentation (NeurobsPresentation), statistics and visualizations (R)

## Abbreviations 
These abbreviations may be used in folder name or filename parts

_Main_
-  **LEMO** shortname for the project title GRAPHOLEMO 
-  **BEH_**  behavioral
-  **MR_**  MRI
-  **feedbacklearning** feedback learning task (main task)
-  **FBL**  abbreviation of feedback learning task, FBL_A and FBL_B refer to the task parts
-  **symctrl** the visual symbol task (control visual task)
-  **ROI** region of interest analysis
-  **func** funcions usually called by scripts with 'run' in their filename
-  **run** scripts that will run analyses using functions in the same folder
-  **GLM** general linear model - used in the main MR analysis scripts. GLM0, GLM1, etc, indicate different versions
-  **rlddm** reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. The versions are added as suffix e.g., \*_rlddm_v12 , etc. Versions descriptions provided in README at the corresponding folder
-  **gpl** used in subject ID to designate the experiment  'grapheme-phoneme-learning' e.g., gpl001
