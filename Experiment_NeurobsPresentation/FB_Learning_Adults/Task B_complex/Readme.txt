Block number coding 
-------------------------------
- Blocks 1 to 4 . These are the actual task blocks. Each starts with a brief refresh practice with stimuli from Task A. It should be map with the corresponding task A block!
- Block 100 . Short practice


FeedLearn_Bcomplex
----------------------
- Symbols + markers are presented
- Markers are diacritic marks placed on top of a symbol to modify its sound (e.g., ¨)
- The symbols are learned in Task A, subjects must now learn how the markers modify the previously learned phoneme
- E.g., V1 sounds /a/ but V1+M1 sounds /aa/.
- Block in the first version has 5 unique sounds repeated 8 times. 


FeedLearn_Bcomplex version 2 
-------------------------------
- Blocks with 6 unique sounds  repeated 8 times (48 trials per block)

Note adjustments in the following times in trial design:
- Stimuli duration (fixed). 
- ITI (jittered) mean duration 
- Feedback onset (jittered ) mean duration
- Feedback duration (fixed)
